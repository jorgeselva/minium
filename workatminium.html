       <h3 class="text-bold"><strong>Want to join us at Minium?</strong></h3>
       <div class="spacer30"></div>
       <h3><strong>Title:</strong> Co-Founder - Software | Consumer Product</h3>
						<h3 class="text-bold">About us:</h3>
						<p>At Minium we believe technology should be simple and mindful. We realized that we were constantly distracted and feeling over-connected by our smartphones. We couldn’t find any exciting minimal solutions, so we decided to build a phone on our own.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>Minium is the first modern minimalist phone. A phone for people that want a phone and nothing more.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>Minium features a crisp e-paper display and lasts weeks on a single charge. The feature set is minimal, the design is beautiful and the user experience is as delightful as on any modern device.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>We’re looking for someone to drive our software team forward to create a beautiful, inspiring experience. The right person will impact the lives of our users and play a significant role in the early stages of an exciting hardware startup while receiving significant equity. We hope this person is you.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>We’re a small team based in downtown Chicago who are passionate about minimalism and technology. We’re focused on getting things done and believe the best way to achieve greatness is by taking quick small steps, test and learn, and iterate over and over again. We believe that anything can be achieved as long as you put in the effort, have a positive attitude and are actively engaging in the community. Both as a company and as co-workers we value transparency and collaboration. We believe work should be fun and care as much about the culture as the product.</p>
					
						<div class="spacer20"></div>
						<h3 class="text-bold">About you:</h3>
						<p>You speak mobile OSs fluently, whether it's higher-end systems like Android, Firefox OS, Sailfish, or an embedded RTOS like Nucleus. You understand the hardware implications of software decisions and make informed choices that benefit the end-product as a whole. We imagine that you have brought up a mobile OS on a new device, or developed a hardware/software product from scratch and taken it to manufacturing (in-house design or ODM). Knowledge in Chinese is a huge plus. </p>
						<div class="spacer20"></div>
						<h3 class="text-bold">Applying:</h3>
						<p>Why are you interested in working with us? Have you been part of a startup before? Do you know what it takes to succeed and are you up for it? </p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>You may submit any supporting files that speak to who you are as a person and why you would be a good fit for this position. Resumes/CVs are great, but we would also like to see something that goes beyond. Past work or projects, your personal blog and online handles are a few examples.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>We look forward to hearing from you! We’re humans and will read every application.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>You can apply by filling out our <a href="http://minium.co/apply.html" target="_blank">application form here</a>.</p>
