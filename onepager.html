       <blockquote><p><em>“Time for me to stop getting warnings that my damn phone is not backing up, time for me to stop worrying that the phone will die if I forget to charge it for just one evening.

       - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8843475" target="_blank">Top comment from a front page post on Hacker News</a> about the Nokia 215, launched in January 2015.</p></blockquote>
       <div class="spacer20"></div>
       <h3 class="text-bold"><strong>Problem</strong></h3>
						<p>The Nokia 215 from the comment above is in essence the same feature phone from the past 10 years with a cheap feel and outdated user experience. And it’s not even sold in North America. Despite this, it hit the front page of Hacker News, Reddit, CNET, and TechCrunch.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>Why? The minimal device struck a chord. People have grown tired of their needy smartphones and want long battery life and a minimal feature set that keeps them connected without distractions and mental clutter.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>However, from personal and observed experience, taking the step and switching to a feature phone like the Nokia can actually increase frustration and be a pain in many aspects. Feature phones simply don’t have many features we’ve grown accustomed to such as beautiful design, threaded text-messaging, and seamless contact syncing.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>The time has come for a new phone that combines the simplicity of feature phones with modern expectations of technology.</p>
						<div class="spacer20"></div>
						 <h3 class="text-bold">Phone</h3>
						<p>Minium is the first modern minimalist phone, a phone for people that want a phone and nothing more. It features a crisp e-paper display and lasts up to a month on a single charge. The feature set is minimal and the user experience is as delightful as on a smartphone.</p>

</p>
</center>
						<div class="spacer20"></div>
						<h3 class="text-bold">Market</h3>
						<p>80MM+ feature phones were sold in North America in 2014 alone. Yet, we care about a smaller group. The minimalists that want to simplify their lives with a simple feature set and modern, beautiful design. The explorers that want to travel for a month on a single charge. The mindful tech consumers that need a tool to curb their over-connection and internet addiction.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>The future is bright. The ill-effects of being over-connected are frequently featured by outlets such as <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2015/01/12/376717870/bored-and-brilliant-a-challenge-to-disconnect-from-your-phone" target="_blank">NPR</a> and <a href="http://time.com/3662846/iphone-separation-study/" target="_blank">TIME</a>. The huge success of very minimal products, such as the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adamleeb/hemingwrite-a-distraction-free-digital-typewriter" target="_blank">Hemingwrite</a>, show the climate is right for focused, less-connected devices. And the appetite is growing for niche mobile phones built by startups, as shown by the success of <a href="http://www.fairphone.com/" target="_blank">Fairphone (fair manufacturing)</a>, <a href="https://blackphone.ch/" target="_blank">Black phone (privacy)</a>, <a href="http://micro-phone.net/" target="_blank">Micro-phone (size)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%27s_Phone" target="_blank">John’s Phone (minimalism)</a>. </p>
						<div class="spacer20"></div>
						<h3 class="text-bold">Roadmap</h3>
						<p>We have a working breadboard prototype that can make and receive calls and text messages. We have made significant progress with our UX and industrial design, and have developed relationships with potential vendors and manufacturers. We wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/life-hacks/do-we-really-need-smartphones-3f877cf83f74" target="_blank">blog post</a> questioning the ubiquity of smartphones in our lives. It was published in the “Life Hacks” collection on Medium and was extremely well received. We surveyed hundreds of minimalists to validate our assumptions and spoke in-depth to dozens to learn about the reasons why the have or want to switch to feature phones.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>We are focusing on releasing a limited-run beta on Kickstarter. We aim to sell 500 pre-orders to prove the market, build our initial community and deliver a high-quality consumer device.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>We are starting with a niche product on purpose - we want to own the market of minimalists and early mindful technology adopters and get deep insights into their real needs. We then plan on expanding the offering with mindful features that align with our vision of reducing mental clutter and distractions.</p>
						<div class="spacer5"></div>
						<p>As a first-mover to deliver an exciting mindful phone, we will grow the category of minimalist, mindful technology and deliver more exciting products and services. </p>
						<div class="spacer20"></div>
						<h3 class="text-bold">Team</h3>
						<p>We come from diverse backgrounds: marketing/design, software and hardware. We have bootstrapped up to this point with minimal founder funding and built a passionate team that loves to execute.</p>
